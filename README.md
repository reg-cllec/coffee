# YelpCoffee&Tea
- 2 Different Activities (Screens): coffee shop List, coffee shop detail View 
- Android app displays coffee shop locations in specified location through a `RecyclerView`
- Uses [RetroFit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library to retreive [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers) data asynchronously 
- Images rendered and cached using [Glide Library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- Displays a new screen activity with multiple images and information for each business
- 
### Demo

### Uses: 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers)
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)

### Reflection:
- In the future I would like to add: 
  - progress bar for loading more in the shop list
  - split into categories of transformer, viewdata, repository, presenter files.
