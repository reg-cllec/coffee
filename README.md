# YelpCoffee&Tea
- 2 Different Activities (Screens): coffee shop List, coffee shop detail View 
- Android app displays coffee/tea locations in specified city through a `RecyclerView`
- Uses [RetroFit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library to retreive [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers) data asynchronously 
- Images rendered and cached using [Glide Library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- Displays a new screen activity with multiple images and information for each business
