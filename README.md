# YelpCoffee&Tea
- 3 Different Activities (Screens): Home, Restaurant List, Restaurant View 
- Android app displays coffee/tea locations in specified city through a `RecyclerView`
- Uses [RetroFit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library to retreive [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers) data asynchronously 
- Images rendered and cached using [Glide Library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
- Displays a new screen activity with multiple images and information for each business

### Uses: 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers)
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview)
- [RetroFit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [Glide Library](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
 
### Reflection:
- In the future I would like to add: 
  - current user location handling when retrieving results (currently it is default to New York) 
  - more relevate data concerning current user - such as when the business would be open or closing (i.e. "Closes in 30 mins")

This was a fun personal project as I love using my phone to browse for new coffee/tea places in my city! It was challenging getting the slideshow of buisness images.
